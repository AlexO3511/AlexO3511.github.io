                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>
                    As many others, my career started out with an intership during undergrad. My first internship was with the Department of Defense of Defense where I was an engineering contractor
                    in Rome, NY. Afterwards, the next 2 summers I interned with John Deere where I really found a passion for engineering. I worked as a On-Board Applications Engineer with Intelligient
                    Soultions Group in Urbandale, Iowa. The following summer I took on the position as a Program Manager at John Deere Crop Harvesting and Development Center. I know that's not engineering
                    but what's an engineer with out a program manager lol. Shortly after my time as an intern, I accepted a postiion with John Deere full time in there Engineering Development Program. 
                    Through this program, over 3 years, I have held 3 different positions as an Embedded Software Systems Engineer, Test Engineer, and Order Fulfillment Process Manufacturing Engineer.
